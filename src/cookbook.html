<h1>Dealing with reported OSM issues</h1>
<h2>Things referred by this guide</h2>
<dl>
<dt>DWG Helper panel</dt>
<dd>The main UI element of the extension. Located either in a browser sidebar, or in an extension popup.</dd>
<dt>issue</dt>
<dd>Collection of reports provided by OSM users linked to a specific OSM entity.
    There are various possible kinds of entities that can have issues linked to them.
    The ones available to <em>moderators</em> are <em>users</em> and <em><a href='https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Notes'>notes</a></em>.
    When a user reports another user or note that wasn't reported before, a new issue is created.
    <em>Moderators</em> (you) then try to sole the issue so it's no longer open.
    If the same user or note gets reported again, their issue is reopened with a new report added.</dd>
<dt>issues list</dt>
<dd>List of issues opened by OSM users on the OSM website.
    Usually we're interested only in <a href='https://www.openstreetmap.org/issues?status=open'>open issues</a>.
    There's a link to this list on the top of <em>DWG Helper panel</em>.</dd>
<dt>issue page</dt>
<dd>Webpage (<code>https://www.openstreetmap.org/issues/<em>issueId</em></code>) on the OSM website containing one or more reports associated with an issue.
    Can be opened through the <em>issues list</em>.</dd>
<dt>customer</dt>
<dd>This is how the user who reported an issue is known inside OTRS.
    Creating an OTRS ticket from an OSM issue attaches the reporting users to the ticket as <em>customers</em>.</dd>
<dt>note</dt>
<dd>Inside OSM note is a message with coordinates left for OSM contributors, telling them about thing that need to be updated in the map data.
    Notes are one of the things that can be reported.
    Inside OTRS note is a type of article that can be added to a ticket, available under <em>Communication</em> menu of a ticket.
    <em>DWG Helper</em> allows to create OTRS notes from OSM reports and messages.
    That means, you can create an OTRS note from an OSM report about an OSM note.</dd>
<dt>phone ticket</dt>
<dd>This is a kind of OTRS ticket created by <em>DWG Helper</em>, for the lack of a better kind.
    From the point of view of OTRS, DWG acts as a customer service, receiving complaints either by email or by phone calls.
    Emails are actually real, there's an address where anyone can send an email and a ticket is going to be automatically created by OTRS.
    There's no phone of course, <em>phone tickets</em> are a way to indicate that these tickets came from some other source.</dd>
<dt>ticket queue</dt>
<dd>A ticket category used in activity reports.
    From the point of view of pretend-customer-service, it would have been a way to assign tickets to different people.
    In DWG it's rarely used that way because tickets are usually handled by whoever created them.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Kinds of issues and what to do with them</h2>
<details id=one-simple>
<summary>One issue that is not worthy of creating a ticket</summary>
<p>These are typically reported by only one user.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <em>issue page</em>.</li>
<li>Do whatever actions required to fix the issue, or what is possible to do before contacting the reporting user.</li>
<li>Contact the reporting user by clicking <em>Quick message reporting user...</em> in <em>DWG Helper panel</em>.
    This opens an OSM message form (<code>https://www.openstreetmap.org/message/new/<em>username</em></code>) with the issue report copied.
<li>Write a message and send it.</li>
<li>Press the <em>resolve issue</em> button in the <em>Ongoing actions</em> section of the panel to resolve the issue.</li>
</ol>
</details>
<details id=several-simple>
<summary>Several related issues reported by one user that are not worthy of creating a ticket</summary>
<p>Typically these are a number of spam or personal information notes reported by one user in quick succession.
   Often you can find them in the <em>issues list</em> by looking for issues with dates very close to each other.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <em>issue page</em> in a new tab.</li>
<li>Do whatever actions required to fix the issue like for <a href='#one-simple'>one issue</a>.</li>
<li>Contact the reporting user by clicking <em>Quick message reporting user...</em> in <em>DWG Helper panel</em>.
    DON'T SEND THE MESSAGE YET.
    Keep the message form tab open.</li>
<li>Go through the remaining issues:
	<ol>
	<li>Switch to <em>issues list</em> tab.</li>
	<li>Open another related <em>issue page</em>.</li>
	<li>Fix the issue.</li>
	<li>If you're not on the issue page tab, switch to it.</li>
	<li>From the issue tab switch directly to the opened and still unfinished message tab.
	This makes <em>DWG Helper</em> understand that you may want to copy data from the issue tab to the message form.
	If done correctly, <em>Add to quick message...</em> should appear in the <em>This+other tab actions</em> section of the panel.</li>
	<li>Click <em>Add to quick message...</em>.
	    Another issue report is going to be appended to the message.</li>
	<li>Repeat if there are undealt related issues left.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Finish writing the message and send it.</li>
<li>Press all the <em>resolve issue</em> buttons in <em>Ongoing actions</em>.</li>
</ol>
</details>
<details id=one-simple-to-ticket>
<summary>One ticket-unworthy issue that became complicated enough for ticket</summary>
<p>This section assumes that the message was already sent and the issue was marked as resolved.
   Now you change our mind and want to create a ticket.</p>
<ol>
<li>Find and open the <em>issue page</em>.
    You can do this by opening the <em>issues list</em> and using a search form on top:
	<ul>
	<li>If a user was reported in the issue, change the status from <em>Open</em> to <em>Resolved</em> and copy the reported username into the <em>Reported User</em> field, then press <em>Search</em>.</li>
	<li>If it was a reported note, you can't search for its id.
	    You can still search by username of the user who created the note like above if the note is not anonymous.
	    Otherwise get the list of all note issues you worked with and find it manually:
	    change the status from <em>Open</em> to <em>Resolved</em>, change <em>Type</em> to <em>Note</em> and in <em>Select Last Updated By</em> pick yourself to limit the number of issues displayed.</li>
	</ul></li>
<li>The report of resolved note is displayed as <em>read</em> and is not selected for ticket creation by default.
    Select the ticket by checking the box next to <img src="icons/ticket.svg" alt="DWG Helper ticket icon"> below the reporter's avatar.</li>
<li>Open a new ticket form <a href=#one-ticket>as usual</a>, by clicking any <em>Create ticket</em> link other than <em>empty</em> in <em>DWG Helper panel</em>.</li>
<li>Alter ticket details as necessary, then click <em>Create</em>.
    A new ticket is going to be open in the current tab.</li>
<li>You're done, unless you want to attach previously sent or received messages to the ticket.
    This makes them visible to other DWG members and searchable by OTRS.
    To attach the messages, first open <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/messages/inbox">your mailbox</a> in a new tab.
	<ol>
	<li>For each message, navigate to it in your mailbox.</li>
	<li>Once on the message webpage, switch to the ticket tab.</li>
	<li>Click <em>Add message... > as note</em> under <em>This+other tab actions</em> of <em>DWG Helper panel</em>.
	    <em>Add note to ticket</em> form is going to appear.</li>
	<li>Submit the form, getting back to the ticket page.</li>
	<li>Repeat for other messages.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
</details>
<details id=one-ticket>
<summary>One issue to be converted to a ticket - the most common case</summary>
<ol>
<li>Open the <em>issue page</em>.
    Don't yet start fixing the issue.</li>
<li>Click any of <em>Create ticket > issue...</em> links in <em>DWG Helper panel</em>.
    If it's a user who is being reported, there are going to be two links.
    One of the links ends with <em>scan user id</em>.
    Click it if you want user id added to the ticket.
    It does an extra step required for retrieving the id.
    You'll want the id if you expect the reported user to change their username, something that they can do any moment.
    After clicking any of the links you'll arrive at <em>Create New Phone Ticket</em> form.</li>
<li>If possible, set the <em>To queue</em> field to an appropriate queue instead of the default one.
    Changing the queue later is going to unlock the ticket.
    Updates to unlocked tickets are received by everyone, not just by its owner.
    You you are going to change the queue later, don't forget to lock the ticket again, if you still intend to work on it.</li>
<li>If possible, set the <em>DWG Region</em>.
    Not all of the ticket update forms have this field.
    If left blank, you'll have to do an extra step of going into <em>Miscellaneous > Free Fields</em> ticket menu item to set it later.</li>
<li>Click <em>Create</em>.
    This takes you to the ticket page.</li>
<li>Press the <em>resolve issue</em> button in the <em>Ongoing actions</em> section of the panel to resolve the issue.
    Now the issue is taken off the open issues list and you can start working on it.</li>
</ol>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Several related issues to be converted to a ticket</summary>
<p>You can deal with them in a similar manner to <a href=#several-simple>several issues in a single message</a>.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>New issue to be added to a related existing ticket</summary>
<ol>
<li>Open a ticket in one tab.</li>
<li>Open an issue in another tab.</li>
<li>Switch from the issue tab to the ticket tab.</li>
<li>Click <em>This+other tab actions > Add selected report(s) > as note</em> in the panel.</li>
</ol>
</details>
<details>
<summary>One issue of several reports to be converted to several tickets</summary>
<p>You may need this if an issue has more than one users reporting it and you want to have a separate communication with each of them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open an issue page.</li>
<li>Deselect all of the unwanted reports with <img src="icons/ticket.svg" alt="DWG Helper ticket icon"> checkboxes.</li>
<li>Click <em>This tab actions > Create ticket > issue...</em>.
    The form should only contain the selected customers and reports.</li>
<li>Proceed with the ticket creation <a href=#one-ticket>as usual</a>.</li>
<li>On the final step, where you used to press the <em>resolve issue</em> button, the button would be replaced by <em>comment issue</em>.
    This button only adds a comment with the link to the ticket.
    It doesn't close the issue because there are likely other reports that still weren't dealt with.</li>
<li>Repeat for different selections of reports until all necessary tickets are created.</li>
<li>Resolve the issue by clicking <em>Resolve</em> on the issue page.</li>
</ol>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Any kind of issue to be converted to a ticket without the help of <em>DWG Helper</em></summary>
<p>You'll need this in case the extension fails, or if a ticket has to be created not from an OSM issue but from some other source.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <em>Create ticket > empty</em> from the panel.</li>
</ol>
